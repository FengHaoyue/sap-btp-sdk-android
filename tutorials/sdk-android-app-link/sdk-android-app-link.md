[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Real world use case)]

![Vendor Image](img-1.jpg)

As a Vendor Manager, you oversee a web and mobile application that enables you to view, manage, and order products from vendors. When a vendor adds a new product using the web app, they notify you via email, providing a web app link to the newly added product for your approval.

As you primarily use the mobile application, you want to click on the link to open the product detail page on your application and perform the necessary action.

*This tutorial, will help you configure [App Links](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/app-link-indexing) on Android, thereby eliminating the need for the user to manually navigate to the product page. Click [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/features/application-links/admin/universal-links.html) to learn more about universal links on SAP BTP SDK Android.*

5. Go the above constructed URL.

    ![Asset JSON File](img-7-5.png)

    > The Asset Links file is a JSON file on the web server of the associated domain. When a user clicks an App Link (web page link), Android checks for the `assetlinks.json` file. If found and configured correctly, Android opens the native app instead of the web page in the browser.

8. Try the following links.

    | URL | Expected Behaviour |
    |----|----|
    | `server_url` | The OS tries to open the URL using the default browser. |
    | `server_url/data` | The OS launches the app. |
    | `server_url/data/product` | The OS launches the app and a toast message specific to products is shown. |
